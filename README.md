# Stats_and_ML_demo_repo
I'm uploading some demo code that gives examples of basic stat and ML techniques.

In this repo, the simplest piece of work shows some linear techniques for fitting curves ('Linear Regression Example'). 
The second piece uses some simple ML techniques to classify MNIST ('Classifying MNIST with Basic Methods').
The final piece wrangles the Titanic dataset and constructs some classifiers to predict survival. We recommend a SVM with an RBF kernel.
